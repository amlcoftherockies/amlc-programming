🛠️ Proposal: When AI Models Fail, Ensemble Models Win
📝 Abstract

What do you do when your domain-specific NLP pipeline achieves only 85% accuracy, and a cutting-edge LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) fails even harder at 46.7%?

This session presents a production case study from Applied Industrials, demonstrating how we combined two failing models into an Ensemble "Judge" System to achieve 100% accuracy on critical industrial data. We will explore how this pattern scales across 295,000+ records in four interconnected systems (Support, BOMs, Specs, Work Instructions) and why "ensemble thinking" is essential for production ML when singular models hit a ceiling.
🎯 Objectives

Participants will walk away understanding:

    The "Judge" Pattern: How to architect a system where models grade each other's predictions.

    Validation Rigor: How to move beyond "lucky examples" to statistical confidence using a 50-example validation suite.

    ROI Analysis: A breakdown of how to calculate the trade-off between cost ($0.03/prediction) and value ($16k annual savings/3,566% ROI).

    Implementation Strategy: A 4-step framework for designing ensembles that scale across different data domains.

👥 Target Audience

    Primary: ML Practitioners and Data Scientists struggling with "good but not production-ready" models.

    Secondary: Engineering Managers and Product Owners needing to understand the cost/accuracy trade-offs of Generative AI.

    Domain: Industrial/Manufacturing focus, but applicable to Fintech, Healthcare, and Systems Engineering.

🧠 Topics Covered

    Ensemble Methods & "Judge" Architectures
