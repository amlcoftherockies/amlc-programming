# 📚 AMLC Archive

Welcome to the **AMLC Archive** — the permanent home for accepted and completed **talks**, **activities**, and **workshops** within the AMLC of the Rockies community.

This archive exists to:

- Provide a transparent record of past proposals and events
- Preserve useful **resources** like recordings, slides, code, and guides
- Track **progress** on ongoing or multi-part projects
- Offer inspiration and structure for future contributors
